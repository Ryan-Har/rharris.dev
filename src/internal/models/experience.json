            "Created multiple SQL scripts to ‘normalise’ the call data from the Nice databases into a format that the Verint import manager could understand. This involved gathering the data from various tables with various relationships and converting it into a single, large, table.",
            "Created a PowerShell script to automate the retrieval of calls from EMC Centera, needed as part of the project due to a limitation of the import software. The script polled the database at a regular interval and pulled the call audio using an API in batches as needed."

This saved around 20 hours of support time per week at the time of implementation."
